<h1>Design philosophy and technical choices</h1>

<p>The framework's primary goal is to be <strong>multi-device</strong>. This has implications on most design decisions.
  The first releases of the framework will focus on having on the number of adapters, not the number or complexity
  of the UI Elements. This makes the framework currently <strong>optimal for multi-device media/content apps</strong>.</p>

<p>Another goal of the framework is also to <strong>avoid bothering developers</strong>. The framework won't impose a crazy IDE, a specific MVC 
  pattern/library or a database choice. Developers should be free to continue using the tools and libraries they love. That said,
  the framework also bundles a selection of great libraries that are mostly not mandatory but are quite standard in their domains,
  to avoid reinventing the wheel.</p>

<h2>Impose what really matters</h2>

<p>In order to be multi-device, there are only two patterns that need to be used by the developers:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/doc/adapters/">The Adapters</a> : One for each supported device, they provide specific implementations
    of base classes or UI Elements.</li>
  <li><a href="/doc/gettingstarted/overview">The Data &amp; UI Trees</a> : They describe the application in an abstract
    and portable way</li>
</ul>

<h2>Let developers stay in their comfort zone for the rest</h2>

<p>Title says all. You are pretty much free to use whatever ORM, Template engine, API library, CSS framework, CoffeeScript clone,
  Webserver framework, ... you want. Some tools may restrict the number of devices your application can be ported on but
  this will just depend on you.</p>
    
<h2>Stand on the shoulders of giants</h2>

<p>Joshfire bundles a number of popular libraries that solve common issues or provide interesting features. You may however not 
  use them at all or replace them by your own.</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/">Underscore.js</a> provides functional programming support</li>
  <li><a href="http://cubiq.org/iscroll-4">iScroll 4</a> is used in the Android and iOS adapters to provide native-like scrolling.</li>
  <li><a href="http://mediaelementjs.com">MediaElement.js</a> is used to provide cross-browser video embedding</li>
  <li><a href="http://socket.io">socket.io</a> is used in the Node.js and Browser adapters</li>
  <li><a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> is used in the Browser adapter by convenience</li>
  <li><a href="http://zeptojs.com/">Zepto</a> is used in the iOS and Android adapters by convenience</li>
  <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/">SWFObject</a> is used in the Browser adapter for embedding SWF files in the DOM</li>
  <li><a href="http://requirejs.org">RequireJS</a> is used only in development mode to load script dynamically and manage dependencies</li>
  
</ul>
