<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>General</h2>

<h3>What makes Joshfire different from other JavaScript frameworks ?</h3>
<p>Joshfire's #1 goal is to be <strong>multi-device</strong> in the widest possible sense: web, mobiles, tablets, desktops, Node.js, connected TVs, even headless devices are supported. <strong>Write once, run everywhere.</strong> It's the first open source framework based on open standards to integrate this cross-platform goal so deep in its design.</p>


<h2>Developers</h2>

<h3>I've downloaded the Joshfire framework archive, extracted it, but the examples won't run</h3>
<p>The current archive contains symbolic links, which some operating systems such as Windows have trouble dealing with. <br />
	This issue will be fixed in a near future update.<br />
	Currently, to overcome this, you should copy the <code>joshfire/lib</code> directory within the examples folders, and rename it <code>joshfire</code>.<br />
	You should now have a <code>joshfire/examples/helloworld/joshfire/</code> folder, mirroring the <code>joshfire/lib/</code> one.<br />
	If you encountered this bug on an unix-based system, or if the aboved instructions didn't fix it, please contact <a href='https://groups.google.com/group/joshfire-dev'>our support</a>

<h3>I've added a new file in an adapter but when I try to require it, only the base class gets loaded.</h3>

<p>This is probably because you forgot to run <code>fab bootstraps</code> to rebuild the list of modules provided by the adapter.</p>


<h3>I got an <code>Uncaught Error: Mismatched anonymous require.def modules</code> after adding my dependencies</h3>
<p>Check that you do have a <code>Joshfire.require(...);</code> entry in your file, not only <code>Joshfire.define(...);</code> </p>

<h3>Are there CSS themes ?</h3>
<p>The framework does not currently ship with pre-made designs other that the ones in the examples, which are however usually a good starting point.</p>

<h3>How do I access my <code>app</code> instance variable ?</h3>
<p>It depends on where you are :
<ul>
	<li>in most classes: via <code>this.app</code></li>
	<li>from outside: you'll have to save a global reference to it in the global scope when instanciating it, the framework doesn't impose any.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Do you use CoffeeScript ?</h3>
<p>No because we want to keep the entry barrier as low as possible for most people. That said, you can obviously write CoffeeScript apps using the framework (please contribute an example!)</p>

<h3>What template engine do you use ?</h3>
<p>By default we use <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#template">underscore.js templates</a> which should be enough for most needs. However you can include your favorite template engine by adding it in a <code>vendor/</code> directory of your application and <a href="/doc/develop/scriptloading">including</a> it.</p>

<h3>Object-oriented ? MVC ?</h3>
<p>The framework uses mixins and simple inheritance internally (with the <a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/">underscore.js</a> library) and it is recommended to do the same in your applications.</p>
<p>Joshfire provides a pretty neat implementation of the MVC pattern: <code>tree.ui</code> and <code>tree.data</code> files allow you to describe separately the interface, the underlying data, and the relationships between them.</p>

<h3>I want to throw custom errors in order to debug properly.</h3>
<p>You could use the standard <code>throw new TypeError()</code> but:
<ul>
  <li>you will probably encounter troubles when compiling your JS files</li>
  <li>it will not be helpful in production mode where line numbers of minified files are meaningless</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>You should rather use the pub/sub mechanism at the <code>app</code> level with the keyword <code>'error'</code>.</p>
<pre><code>
try {
	// something risky here
} catch (e) {
	return app.publish('error', 
		{	message:'samsungtv VideoMediaElement : no URL given',
			number:21,
			origin:'adapters/samsungtv/ui/video.mediaelement' 
		});
}
</pre></code>
<p>You should at least provide a <code>message</code> property containing both the error and the object it comes from. Adding the pathfile and an error number is recommanded for debugging purpose.</p>
