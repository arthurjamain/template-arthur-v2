<h1>The video list example</h1>
<p>Why a video list ? We actually over-simplified a <a href="http://couchmode.myskreen.com/">real application</a>. The first Joshlib Framework users came from the media industry, and they knew the value of being present on as much devices as possible, so our first efforts were made on playing video everywhere.</p>
<p>The goal here is to have an application backported on ALL the adapters weâ€˜re adding to the library. You will learn to :
<ul>
	<li>adopt a CSS strategy
	<li>customize your application on a per-device basis
	<li>use the build tools to deploy on a multitude of devices
	<li>play video everywhere
	<li>see the grid + list in action, accessible via a keyboard, a mouse, a remote control or your finger
	<li>preserve your SEO with the node adapter
	<li>plan your code for different behaviours between devices

</ul>
